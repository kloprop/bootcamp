### Quest 10:  
Insert an elements into a specific position of the array
(1. Copy the ele before pos to new arr, insert ele, copy remaining ele to the arr 2.Use i-- and i> pos to insert in the original array)
Use reverse to update the original array arr[j] = arr[j-1]

### Quest 11: 
Delay time (If more than 24, change it)
        
### Quest 12: 
TwoSum (Double for loop to add every elements)
        
### Quest 13: 
Changing temperature (Applying methods)

### Quest 14: 
Palindrome

### Quest 15: return occurance of letter in the form of percentage

Problem: count/str.length always return 0.
Reason: int divides int always return int, if you need a double, change one of them to double

Problem: failed to return the percentage in int form. 
Resaon: downcasting is required for double to change to int. Be aware of the location of (int) and (),
        make sure that downcasting apply to the whole value 

### Quest 16: sum to zero
Problem: Just suck at thinking how to sum up to zero
Reason: Suddenly pop up the idea, really do not know why. Try to break down the q into small part. Imagine cases
        that would sum to zero. Please take a rest and claim down when suck.

### Quest 17: minimum35Number
similar to leet code 69, foucs on changing type( int to string to charArray)

### Quest 18: firstPalindrome
